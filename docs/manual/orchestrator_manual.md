      - Allows user-input-based generation for individual Wallets and DID Documents.

## 4. Precautions
- **Server Start/Stop Delay**: Using the `Start` or `Stop` buttons may take some time depending on the server environment.
- **Individual Entity Settings**: Use the `Settings` button to adjust individual server configurations.
- **Security**: Passwords used for generating Wallets and DID Documents should be managed securely.

*Orchestrator is intended for managing and monitoring the operation of individual entities. Detailed configurations must be handled on each entityâ€™s own settings page.*
